    This is a simple maze adventure game script thing
    for the purpose of learning to code with python,
    also to exercise some creative writing skills.

    It may not be perfect, as this is my first "big project".

    I'm looking forward to any feedback from the community with
    opportunities to learn and evolve my programming skills!

    
    
    I hope it's as enjoyable to run as it was to write.

            :)
